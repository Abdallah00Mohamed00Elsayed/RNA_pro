# RNA-Seq Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project involves RNA sequencing data analysis with a focus on treatment outcomes in Leishmania-infected patients. Key steps include data preprocessing, transformation, filtering, differential expression analysis, and pathway exploration.

## Key Steps:
1. Processed study design and created gene abundance files using transcript-to-gene mapping and Kallisto data.
2. Transformed expression data into log2 counts per million (CPM) and visualized gene expression before and after filtering using violin plots.
3. Filtered data by removing low-expressed genes and retained significant ones for further analysis.
4. Performed differential gene expression analysis, identifying genes linked to treatment outcomes, and visualized results through volcano plots.
5. Conducted Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis to explore biological pathways potentially involved in treatment failure.
